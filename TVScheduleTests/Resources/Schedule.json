It is taped at Chelsea Television Studios in New York City. The show's 8th season premiered on September 9, 2013, and became the last Harpo show in syndication to switch to HD with a revamped studio. The concept behind this program showcases Ray's culinary skills. She brings various celebrities on screen to discuss their accomplishments in the entertainment, sports, and media industries. Ray asks for tips and strategies for staying healthy and safe from various health and lifestyle experts, she includes make-over segments, and features musical performances, all of which are features along the same lines of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>. She does, however, keep cooking in the forefront by including at least one cooking segment at the end of each episode, and sometimes inviting her celebrity guests to join her in the kitchen. According to Ray, \"People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share\". The set has the audience seated on a large turntable that rotates so that the audience can always see the \"action\" on the circular stage that surrounds them. At the end of each show, with the exception of a few more guests after Ray's cooking segments, Ray's tagline is, \"We'll see you when we see you\".</p>","updated":1525160392,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/9077"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1461577"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1461578"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1461577"}}},{"id":1457372,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1457372/the-chew-7x152-chicken-fried-everything","name":"Chicken-Fried Everything!","season":7,"number":152,"airdate":"2018-05-02","airtime":"13:00","airstamp":"2018-05-02T17:00:00+00:00","runtime":60,"image":null,"summary":"<p>It's Carla's choice and she's making a mind-blowing fried chicken favorite; Michael is cooking with chef Alex Guarnaschelli (cookbook, \"The Home Cook\"); senior culinary stylist Jackie Rothong takes us on a tour of the most Insta-worthy NYC restaurants.</p>","show":{"id":7525,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/7525/the-chew","name":"The Chew","type":"Talk Show","language":"English","genres":["Food","Family"],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"premiered":"2015-09-09","officialSite":"http://abc.go.com/shows/the-chew","schedule":{"time":"13:00","days":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":89,"network":{"id":3,"name":"ABC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":257610,"imdb":"tt2071236"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/27/69502.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/27/69502.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>The Chew</b> celebrates and explores life through food, with a group of dynamic, engaging, fun, relatable co-hosts who serve up everything to do with food -- from cooking and home entertaining to food trends, restaurants, holidays and more -- all aimed at making life better, fuller and more fun.

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.
