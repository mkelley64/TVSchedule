It is taped at Chelsea Television Studios in New York City. The show's 8th season premiered on September 9, 2013, and became the last Harpo show in syndication to switch to HD with a revamped studio. The concept behind this program showcases Ray's culinary skills. She brings various celebrities on screen to discuss their accomplishments in the entertainment, sports, and media industries. Ray asks for tips and strategies for staying healthy and safe from various health and lifestyle experts, she includes make-over segments, and features musical performances, all of which are features along the same lines of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>. She does, however, keep cooking in the forefront by including at least one cooking segment at the end of each episode, and sometimes inviting her celebrity guests to join her in the kitchen. According to Ray, \"People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share\".

Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist.

The show was created by veteran newsmen Robert MacNeil &amp; Jim Lehrer, and has been on the air since 1975. In 2009, the show, previously known as The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer, became PBS NewsHour. One of the major differences between network news and the PBS NewsHour is that because the show is publicly funded, there are no commercials. This allows the NewsHour to dedicate more time to comprehensive reporting. The nightly broadcast features a two-anchor format, with a rotation of NEWSHOUR senior correspondents Gwen Ifill, Judy Woodruff and Jeffrey Brown. Senior correspondents Margaret Warner and Ray Suarez deliver compelling original reporting &amp; newsmaker interviews from the field. Correspondent Hari Sreenivasan delivers news to the digital world and anchors the news summary on the television broadcasts.</p>","updated":1524962030,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/10563"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1459677"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1459678"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1384183"}}},{"id":1360384,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1360384/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-2017-12-01-carol-burnett-lewis-black","name":"Carol Burnett, Lewis Black","season":2017,"number":188,"airdate":"2017-12-01","airtime":"23:35","airstamp":"2017-12-02T04:35:00+00:00","runtime":60,"image":null,"summary":"<p>Actress/comedian Carol Burnett; comic Lewis Black.</p>","show":{"id":2756,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/2756/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert","name":"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert","type":"Talk Show","language":"English","genres":["Comedy"],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"premiered":"2015-09-08","officialSite":"http://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/","schedule":{"time":"23:35","days":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"]},"rating":{"average":6.2},"weight":98,"network":{"id":2,"name":"CBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":41941,"thetvdb":289574,"imdb":"tt3697842"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/18/47217.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/18/47217.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Stephen Colbert takes over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.
